1. Suppose that in an instance of the Stable Matching problem where a man m ranks a woman
w as his first choice, and the woman w also ranks the man m as her first choice. Prove that
in any stable matching, m and w will be matched.


let M* be the set of all matches in all stable matching

suppose that m - w is not matched but instead a - w and m - b is made, where a is a man other than m and b is a woman other than w, and a and b are lower in preference list to both m and w respectively.

suppose the following 2 scenarios

m had not proposed to w
m should have propsed to w as proposals happen down the preference list (contradiction);

m had propsed to w
if m had proposed to w, and was not matched, it would mean w had rejected m as she believed her current match a > m. however, as m > a in preference list of w , (contradiction);

hence, all possibilities of a - w and m - b is not possible in any stable matches. thus, m-w matching should occur in all stable matchings.



2. from question 1, it had been proven that when both a man m and a woman w ranks each other as #1 in their preference list, the matching m-w exist in all stable matching.
Hence, if Xinyu rearranges her input as such Ashish , Bao , Charlie,

as both Ashish and Xinyu has both of their preferences at #1, Ashish and Xinyu will always be matched regardless of male - proposed / female - proposed.  --1

Similarly, Yashoda and Bao would be matched.  --2

This will leave Zuzu to be matched with the remaining unproposed man Charlie

due to all other woman than zuzu being matched with their #1 preference, from statement 1 and 2,

 which shows that the the following matches, ashish - xinyu and bao - yashoda will both remain in male / female proposed stable matchings (since this match exist in all forms of stable matching), 

 this renders the zuzu- charlie match to also remain in both the male/ female optimal stable matching. As male stable == female stable matching, Xinyu can indeed cheat to to output the women-optimal stable matching from a male-optimal stable matching



 3. 

 "quoted"
The formula was particularly likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, wrongly labeling them this way at almost twice the rate as white defendants.

White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants.
